	"summary": "Iâ€™m an information sponge and Open Source fanatic. I love to pick up new concepts or languages and apply them to problems. I am at my best when I am in a group of intelligent people with diverse backgrounds and skill sets; I crave learning from people like that, and hope to teach them something in the process. The idea of making applications that people use, and enjoy using, is exciting to me; it is the overwhelming reason why I chose my specific education."
