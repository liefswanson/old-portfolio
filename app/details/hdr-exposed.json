Values further from approximately 50% brightness needed to have less weight; in theory, very dark and very light pixels have low information. The only downfall here is that the function’s derivative has a very high magnitude near the 50% brightness mark. I thought of ways to avoid this, but the only practical one I had was to try to compose a piecewise continuous function that didn’t go to 0. This problem can create stitches of visual noise in the output image.",
