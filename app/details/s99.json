I tried going through the 99 Problems in Scala (a port of the famous 99 Problems in Lisp). I am slowly making my way through it. At the time of writing this I am at question 35. Though, I found the strongest teaching experience I have gained from this is when I run into questions where the answers are actually incorrect in current iterations of Scala. Ever since the addition of runtime reflection libraries in Scala, in order to circumvent type erasure, much has changed in valid Scala program structure.",
