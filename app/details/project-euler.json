If a person opts into doing something and then cheats just so they can answer a question that no one will be judging them on, really no one loses anything. Except the person that lost their time copying and pasting a few lines of text.",

Though, I will admit that I think whoever comes up with the questions over there really likes Haskell. Most of the answers are trivially expressed in little more than 5 lines of Haskell.",
