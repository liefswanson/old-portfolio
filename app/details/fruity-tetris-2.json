There are still fruits, but they no longer get destroyed… instead, an ominous arm drops the blocks anywhere on the canvas it chooses, and the camera can now move around the board, rendering a 3D perspective. This was mostly just an exercise in the use of Euler Angles in 3D. Which I wasn’t all that happy with. I would have preferred we tackled quaternions. I ended up having to do that on my own later.",

However, I managed to make it so that I actually only stored one tile in memory and could still render the whole board by swapping out the shaders and moving the block around. This isn’t, strictly speaking, the right way to go about things, but it was fun...",
