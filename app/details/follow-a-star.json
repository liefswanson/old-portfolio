The usual euclidean distance is useful, but can be unrepresentative in many realistic situations where obstacles are concerned. Instead, one can use a nifty trick that takes advantage of the Pythagorean Theorem. This approach, known as landmarking, allows for a significantly lower margin of error in the best path estimates that A* uses to find a location. All that is required is some precomputation of the search space, via Dijkstra's algorithm. The only problem is that each landmark takes up as much memory as all the nodes in the graph, so having many of them is not all that practical in large search spaces.",
